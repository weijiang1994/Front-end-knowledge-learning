#### Basic CSS

##### 1. Introduction to Basic CSS

Cascading Style Sheet(CSS) tell the browser how to display the text and other content that you write in HTML.

Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization.

CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control:

- color
- fonts
- positioning
- spacing
- sizing
- decorations
- transitions

There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with the `style` attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within `style` tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML doucument. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developert prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles separate from the HTML elements. This is imporves the readability and reusability of your code.

This idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM(document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.

In this seciotn, you will see how adding CSS styles to the elementes of your CatPhotoApp can change it from simple text to something more.

> Note: Some browsers extensions may interface with elements on the page. If the tests fail, try disabling your extensions for the most reliable experience.

##### 2. Change the Color  of Text

Now let's change the color of some of our text.

We can do this by changing the `style` of your `h2` element.

The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the `color` style property.

Here's how you would set your `h2` element's text color to blue:

```html
<h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

Note that it is a good practice to end inline `style` declarations with a `;` .

> Challenge

> Change your `h2` element's style so that it is text color is red.

```html
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

---

##### 3. Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.

When you entered `<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>`, you were styling that individual `h2` element with inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS.

At the top of your code, create a `style` block like this:

```html
<style></style>
```

Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all `h2` elements. For example, if you wanted all `h2` elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this:

```html
<style>
  h2 {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```

Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces (`{` and `}`) around each element's style rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.

> Challenge
>
> Delete your `h2` element's style attribute, and instead create a CSS `style` block. Add the necessary CSS to turn all `h2` elements blue.

```html
<style>
    h2{
        color: blue;
    }
</style>
<h2>
    CatPhotoApp
</h2>
```

---

##### 4. Use a CSS Class to Style an Element

Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

```html
<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
</style>
```

You can see that we've created a CSS class called `blue-text` within the `<style>` tag. You can apply a class to an HTML element like this: `<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>` Note that in your CSS `style` element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.

> Challegen
>
> Inside your `style` element, change the `h2` selector to `.red-text` and update the color's value from `blue` to `red`.
>
> Give your `h2` element the `class` attribute with a value of `'red-text'`.

```html
<style>
    .red-text{
        color: red;
    }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">
    CatPhotoApp
</h2>
```

---

##### 5. Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class

Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. 

> Challenge
>
> You can see this by applying your `red-text` class to the first `p` element.

```html
<style>
    .red-text{
        color: red;
    }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">
    CatPhotoApp
</h2>
<p class="red-text">
    Click here to view more.
</p>
```

---

##### 6. Change the Font Size of an Element

Font size is controlled by the `font-size` CSS property, like this:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 30px;
}
```

> Challenge
>
> Inside the same `<style>` tag that contains your `red-text` class, create an entry for `p` elements and set the `font-size` to 16 pixels (`16px`).

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
  p{
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>
```

---

##### 7. Set the Font Family of an Element

You can set which font an element should use, by using the `font-family` property.

For example, if you wanted to set your `h2` element's font to `sans-serif`, you would use the following CSS:

```css
h2 {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

> Challenge
>
> Make all of your `p` element use the `monospace` font.

```html
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p class="red-text">Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>
```

---

##### 8. Import a Google Font

In addition to specifying common fonts that are found on most operating systems, we can also specify non-standard, custom web fonts for use on our website. There are many sources for web fonts on the Internet. For this example we will focus on the Google Fonts library.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a free library of web fonts that you can use in your CSS by referencing the font's URL.

So, let's go ahead and import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will need to skip this challenge).

To import a Google Font, you can copy the font(s) URL from the Google Fonts library and then paste it in your HTML. For this challenge, we'll import the `Lobster` font. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor (before the opening `style` element):

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
```

Now you can use the `Lobster` font in your CSS by using `Lobster` as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:

```html
font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;.
```

The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.

Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the `"Open Sans"` font, but not to use the `Lobster` font.

> Challenge
>
> Create a `font-family` CSS rule that uses the `Lobster` font, and ensure that it will be applied to your `h2` element.

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<style>
    h2 {
       font-family: Lobster; 
    }
</style>
```

---

##### 9. Specify How Fonts Should Degrade

There are several default fonts that are available in all browsers. These generic font families include `monospace`, `serif` and `sans-serif`

When one font isn't available, you can tell the browser to "degrade" to another font.

For example, if you wanted an element to use the `Helvetica` font, but degrade to the `sans-serif` font when `Helvetica` isn't available, you will specify it as follows:

```css
p {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

Generic font family names are not case-sensitive. Also, they do not need quotes because they are CSS keywords.

> Challenge
>
> To begin, apply the `monospace` font to the `h2` element, so that it now has two fonts - `Lobster` and `monospace`.
>
> In the last challenge, you imported the `Lobster` font using the `link` tag. Now comment out that import of the `Lobster` font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore. Notice how your `h2` element degrades to the `monospace` font.
>
> **Note:** If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font.

```html
<!--<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> -->
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  h2 {
    font-family: Lobster, monospace;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
```

---

##### 10. Size Your Images

CSS has a property called `width` that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use `px` (pixels) to specify the image's width.

For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called `larger-image` that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use:

```html
<style>
  .larger-image {
    width: 500px;
  }
</style>
```

> Challege
>
> Create a class called `smaller-image` and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.
>
> **Note:** Due to browser implementation differences, you may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the tests on this challenge.

```html
<style>
    .smaller-image{
        width: 100px;
    }
</style>
<img class="smaller-image" src="">
```

---

##### 11. Add Borders Around Your Elements

CSS borders have properties like `style`, `color` and `width`.

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class:

```html
<style>
  .thin-red-border {
    border-color: red;
    border-width: 5px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>
```

> Challenge
>
> Create a class called `thick-green-border`. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo.
>
> Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its `class` attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example:
>
> ```html
> <img class="class1 class2">
> ```

```html
<style>
.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<img class="thick-green-border smaller-image" src="">
```

---

##### 12. Add Rounded Corners with border-radius

Your cat photo currently has sharp corners. We can round out those corners with a CSS property called `border-radius`.

> Challenge
>
> You can specify a `border-radius` with pixels. Give your cat photo a `border-radius` of `10px`.
>
> **Note:** This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add `border-radius` to either the `.thick-green-border` class or the `.smaller-image` class.

```html
<style>
.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 10px;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<img class="thick-green-border smaller-image" src="">
```

---

##### 13. Make Circular Images with a border-radius

In addition to pixels, you can also specify the `border-radius` using a percentage.

> Challenge
>
> Give you cat photo a `border-radius` of `50%`

```html
<style>
.thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>
<img class="thick-green-border smaller-image" src="">
```

---

##### 14. Give a Background Color to a div Element

You can set an element's background color with the `background-color` property.

For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be `green`, you'd put this within your `style` element:

```css
.green-background {
  background-color: green;
}
```

> Challenge
>
> Create a class called `silver-background` with the `background-color` of silver. Assign this class to your `div` element.

```html
<style>
    .silver-background{
        background-color: silver;
    }
</style>
<div class="silver-background">
    <p>Things cats love:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>cat nip</li>
      <li>laser pointers</li>
      <li>lasagna</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>flea treatment</li>
      <li>thunder</li>
      <li>other cats</li>
    </ol>
</div>
```

##### 15. Set the id of an Element

In addition to classes, each HTML element can also have an `id` attribute.

There are several benefits to using `id` attributes: You can use an `id` to style a single element and later you'll learn that you can use them to select and modify specific elements with JavaScript.

`id` attributes should be unique. Browsers won't enforce this, but it is a widely agreed upon best practice. So please don't give more than one element the same `id` attribute.

Here's an example of how you give your `h2` element the id of `cat-photo-app`:

```html
<h2 id="cat-photo-app"></h2>
```

> Challenge
>
> Give your `form` element the id `cat-photo-form`.

```html
<form id="cat-photo-form" action="/submit-cat-photo">
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor" checked> Indoor</label>
    <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label><br>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality" checked> Loving</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label><br>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
```

---

##### 16. Use an id Attribute to Style an Element

One cool thing about `id` attributes is that, like classes, you can style them using CSS.

However, an `id` is not reusable and should only be applied to one element. An `id` also has a higher specificity (importance) than a class so if both are applied to the same element and have conflicting styles, the styles of the `id` will be applied.

Here's an example of how you can take your element with the `id` attribute of `cat-photo-element` and give it the background color of green. In your `style` element:

```css
#cat-photo-element {
  background-color: green;
}
```
