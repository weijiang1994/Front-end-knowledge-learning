##### 1.Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property

This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

Text is often a large part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the `text-align` property.

`text-align: justify;` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

`text-align: center;` centers the text

`text-align: right;` right-aligns the text

And `text-align: left;` (the default) left-aligns the text.

> **Challenge**
>
> Align the `h4` tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;

  }
  .fullCard {
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### 2.Adjust the Width of an Element Using the width Property

You can specify the width of an element using the `width` property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

```css
img {
  width: 220px;
}
```

> **Challenge**
>
> Add a `width` property to the entire card and set it to an absolute value of 245px. Use the `fullCard` class to select the element.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;
    text-align: left;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

##### 3.Adjust the Height of an Element Using the height Property

You can specify the height of an element using the `height` property in CSS, similar to the `width` property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:

```css
img {
  height: 20px;
}
```

> **Challeng**
>
> Add a `height` property to the `h4` tag and set it to 25px.
>
> **Note:** You may need to be at 100% zoom to pass the test on this challenge.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    margin-right: 20px;
    text-align: left;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Brin" target="_blank" class="links">Sergey Brin</a>
    </div>

##### 4.Use the strong Tag to Make Text Bold

To make text bold, you can use the `strong` tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the `strong` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `font-weight: bold;` to the element.

> **Challenge**
>
> Wrap a `strong` tag around "Stanford University" inside the `p` tag (do not include the period).

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">

##### 5.Use the u Tag to Underline Text

To underline text, you can use the `u` tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the `u` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element.

> **Challenge**
>
> Wrap the `u` tag only around the text "Ph.D. students".
>
> **Note:** Try to avoid using the `u` tag when it could be confused for a link. Anchor tags also have a default underlined formatting.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cardLinks">
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page" target="_blank" class="links">Larry Page</a><br><br>

##### 6.Use the em Tag to Italicize Text

To emphasize text, you can use the `em` tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of `font-style: italic;` to the element.

> **Challenge**
>
> Wrap an `em` tag around the contents of the paragraph tag to give it emphasis.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Google</h4>
      <p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>

##### 7.Use the s Tag to Strikethrough Text

To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the `s` tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the `s` tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: line-through;` to the element.

> **Challenge**
>
> Wrap the `s` tag around "Google" inside the `h4` tag and then add the word Alphabet beside it, which should not have the strikethrough formatting.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>
      
      <p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>

##### 8.Create a Horizontal Line Using the hr Element

You can use the `hr` tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.

> **Challenge**
>
> Add an `hr` tag underneath the `h4` which contains the card title.
>
> **Note:** In HTML, `hr` is a self-closing tag, and therefore doesn't need a separate closing tag.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    height: 25px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4><s>Google</s>Alphabet</h4>

##### 9.Adjust the background-color Property of Text

Instead of adjusting your overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, you can add a `background-color` to the element holding the text you want to emphasize. This challenge uses `rgba()` instead of `hex` codes or normal `rgb()`.

>rgba stands for:
> r = red
> g = green
> b = blue
> a = alpha/level of opacity

The RGB values can range from 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. `rgba()` is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out the background.

You'll use `background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)` for this challenge. It produces a dark gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1.

> **Challenge**
>
> To make the text stand out more, adjust the `background-color` of the `h4` element to the given `rgba()` value.
>
> Also for the `h4`, remove the `height` property and add `padding` of 10px.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    padding: 10px;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);

  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Alphabet</h4>
      <hr>
      <p><em>Google was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were <u>Ph.D. students</u> at <strong>Stanford University</strong>.</em></p>

##### 10.Adjust the Size of a Header Versus a Paragraph Tag

The font size of header tags (`h1` through `h6`) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. You use the `font-size` property to adjust the size of the text in an element.

> **Challenge**
>
> To make the heading significantly larger than the paragraph, change the `font-size` of the `h4` tag to 27 pixels.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard">
  <div class="cardContent">
    <div class="cardText">
      <h4>Alphabet</h4>
      <hr>

##### 11.Add a box-shadow to a Card-like Element

The `box-shadow` property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The `box-shadow` property takes values for

- `offset-x` (how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element),
- `offset-y` (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element),
- `blur-radius`,
- `spread-radius` and
- `color`, in that order.

The `blur-radius` and `spread-radius` values are optional.

Multiple box-shadows can be created by using commas to separate properties of each `box-shadow` element.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

```css
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
```

> **Challenge**
>
> The element now has an id of `thumbnail`. With this selector, use the example CSS values above to place a `box-shadow` on the card.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;
  }
  #thumbnail{
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
  }


  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
</style>

##### 12.Decrease the Opacity of an Element

The `opacity` property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

> A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
> A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
> A value of 0 is completely transparent.

The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.

> **Challenge**
>
> Set the `opacity` of the anchor tags to 0.7 using `links` class to select them.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;
    background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1);
    padding: 10px;
    font-size: 27px;
  }
  p {
    text-align: justify;
  }
  .links {
    text-align: left;
    color: black;

  }
  #thumbnail {
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
  }
  .fullCard {
    width: 245px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 10px 5px;
    padding: 4px;
  }
  .cardContent {
    padding: 10px;
  }
  .cardText {
    margin-bottom: 30px;
  }
  .links{
    opacity: 0.7;
  }
</style>
<div class="fullCard" id="thumbnail">

##### 13.Use the text-transform Property to Make Text Uppercase

The `text-transform` property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.

The following table shows how the different `text-transform`values change the example text "Transform me".

![image-20200715005327224](.\img\image-20200715005327224.png)

> **Challenge**
>
> Transform the text of the `h4` to be uppercase using the `text-transform` property.

```html
<style>
  h4 {
    text-align: center;

##### 14.Set the font-size for Multiple Heading Elements

The `font-size` property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all `h1` through `h6` tags to balance the heading sizes.

> **Challenge**
>
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h1` tag to 68px.
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h2` tag to 52px.
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h3` tag to 40px.
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h4` tag to 32px.
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h5` tag to 21px.
> - Set the `font-size` of the `h6` tag to 14px.

```html
<style>
h1{
  font-size: 68px;
}

h2{
  font-size: 52px;
}

h3{
  font-size: 40px;
}

h4{
  font-size: 32px;
}

h5{
  font-size: 21px;
}

h6{
  font-size: 14px;
}

</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>
```

##### 15.Set the font-weight for Multiple Heading Elements

You set the `font-size` of each heading tag in the last challenge, here you'll adjust the `font-weight`.

The `font-weight` property sets how thick or thin characters are in a section of text.

> **Challenge**
>
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h1` tag to 800.
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h2` tag to 600.
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h3` tag to 500.
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h4` tag to 400.
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h5` tag to 300.
> - Set the `font-weight` of the `h6` tag to 200.

```html
<style>
  h1 {
    font-size: 68px;
    font-weight: 800;
  }
  h2 {
    font-size: 52px;
	font-weight: 600;
  }
  h3 {
    font-size: 40px;
	font-weight: 500;
  }
  h4 {
    font-size: 32px;
	font-weight: 400;
  }
  h5 {
    font-size: 21px;
	font-weight: 300;
  }
  h6 {
    font-size: 14px;
	font-weight: 200;
  }
</style>
<h1>This is h1 text</h1>
<h2>This is h2 text</h2>
<h3>This is h3 text</h3>
<h4>This is h4 text</h4>
<h5>This is h5 text</h5>
<h6>This is h6 text</h6>
```

##### 16.Set the font-size of Paragraph Text

The `font-size` property in CSS is not limited to headings, it can be applied to any element containing text.

> **Challenge**
>
> Change the value of the `font-size` property for the paragraph to 16px to make it more visible.

```html
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
  }
</style>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

##### 17.Set the line-height of Paragraphs

CSS offers the `line-height` property to change the height of each line in a block of text. As the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets.

> **Challenge**
>
> Add a `line-height` property to the `p` tag and set it to 25px.

```html
<style>
  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 25px;
  }
</style>
<p>
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

##### 18.Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag

This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the `:hover` pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the `color` of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:

```css
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
```

> **Challenge**
>
> The code editor has a CSS rule to style all `a` tags black. Add a rule so that when the user hovers over the `a` tag, the `color` is blue.

```html
<style>
  a {
    color: #000;
  }

  a:hover {
    color: blue;
  }


</style>
<a href="http://freecatphotoapp.com/" target="_blank">CatPhotoApp</a>
```

##### 19.Change an Element's Relative Position

CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the CSS Box Model. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the normal flow of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

When the position of an element is set to `relative`, it allows you to specify how CSS should move it *relative* to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of `left` or `right`, and `top` or `bottom`. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the item *away* from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:

```css
p {
  position: relative;
  bottom: 10px;
}
```

Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow - other elements around it still behave as if that item were in its default position.

**Note:** Positioning gives you a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access your content.

> **Challenge**
>
> Change the `position` of the `h2` to `relative`, and use a CSS offset to move it 15 pixels away from the `top` of where it sits in the normal flow. Notice there is no impact on the positions of the surrounding h1 and p elements.

```html
<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    top: 15px;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
```

![image-20200715175756003](.\img\image-20200715175756003.png)



---

##### 20.Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets

The CSS offsets of `top` or `bottom`, and `left` or `right` tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the `h2` downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

![image-20200716005423101](.\img\image-20200716005423101.png)

> **Challenge**
>
> Use CSS offsets to move the `h2` 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.

```html
<head>
<style>
  h2 {
    position: relative;
    bottom: 10px;
    left: 15px;
  }
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>On Being Well-Positioned</h1>
  <h2>Move me!</h2>
  <p>I still think the h2 is where it normally sits.</p>
</body>
```

##### 21.Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning

The next option for the CSS `position` property is `absolute`, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the `relative` position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest *positioned* ancestor. If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using `position: relative;`), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.

> **Challenge**
>
> Lock the `#searchbar` element to the top-right of its `section` parent by declaring its `position` as `absolute`. Give it `top` and `right` offsets of 50 pixels each.

```html
<style>
  #searchbar {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50px;
    right: 50px;


  }
  section {
    position: relative;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <section>
    <form id="searchbar">
      <label for="search">Search:</label>
      <input type="search" id="search" name="search">
      <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Go!">
    </form>
  </section>
</body>
```

![image-20200716162659797](.\img\image-20200716162659797.png)

---

##### 22.Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the `fixed` position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the `fixed` and `absolute` positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls.

> **Challenge**
>
> The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of `navbar`. Change its `position` to `fixed`, and offset it 0 pixels from the `top` and 0 pixels from the `left`. After you have added the code, scroll the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place.

```html
<style>
  body {
    min-height: 150vh;
  }
  #navbar {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    right: 0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: #767676;
  }
  nav ul {
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 5px 0px 5px 30px;
  }
  nav li {
    display: inline;
    margin-right: 20px;
  }
  a {
    text-decoration: none;
  }
</style>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <nav id="navbar">
      <ul>
        <li><a href="">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <p>I shift up when the #navbar is fixed to the browser window.</p>
</body>
```

##### 23.Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property

The next positioning tool does not actually use `position`, but sets the `float` property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the `left` or `right` of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the `width` property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.

> **Challenge**
>
> The given markup would work well as a two-column layout, with the `section` and `aside` elements next to each other. Give the `#left` item a `float` of `left` and the `#right` item a `float` of `right`.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    #left {
      float: left;
      width: 50%;
    }
    #right {
      float: right;
      width: 40%;
    }
    aside, section {
      padding: 2px;
      background-color: #ccc;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  </header>
  <section id="left">
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>Good stuff</p>
  </section>
  <aside id="right">
    <h2>Sidebar</h2>
    <p>Links</p>
  </aside>
</body>
```

##### 24.Change the Position of Overlapping Elements with the z-index Property

When elements are positioned to overlap (i.e. using `position: absolute | relative | fixed | sticky`), the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the `z-index` property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an integer (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the `z-index` property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.

> **Challenge**
>
> Add a `z-index` property to the element with the class name of `first` (the red rectangle) and set it to a value of 2 so it covers the other element (blue rectangle).

```
<style>
  div {
    width: 60%;
    height: 200px;
    margin-top: 20px;
  }

  .first {
    background-color: red;
    position: absolute;
    z-index:2;
  }
  .second {
    background-color: blue;
    position: absolute;
    left: 40px;
    top: 50px;
    z-index: 1;
  }
</style>

<div class="first"></div>
<div class="second"></div>
```

##### 25.Center an Element Horizontally Using the margin Property

Another positioning technique is to center a block element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its `margin` to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when you set the `display` property to block.

> **Challenge**
>
> Center the `div` on the page by adding a `margin` property with a value of auto.

```html
<style>
  div {
    background-color: blue;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin: auto;
  }
</style>
<div></div>
```

##### 26.Learn about Complementary Colors

Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

The color wheel is a useful tool to visualize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.

Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:

>red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
>green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
>blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)

**Note:** For all color challenges: Using color can be a powerful way to add visual interest to a page. However, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because users with visual impairments may not understand that content. This issue will be covered in more detail in the Applied Accessibility challenges.

> **Challenge**
>
> Change the `background-color` property of the `blue` and `yellow` classes to their respective colors. Notice how the colors look different next to each other than they do compared against the white background.

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
  }
  .blue {
    background-color: #0000FF;
  }
  .yellow {
    background-color: #FFFF00;
  }
  div {
    display: inline-block;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px; 
  }
</style>
<div class="blue"></div>
<div class="yellow"></div>
```

##### 27.Learn about Tertiary Colors

Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amounts of red, green, and blue light. This is known as the RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G + B), magenta (R + B) and yellow (R + G). You saw these colors in the Complementary Colors challenge. These secondary colors happen to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, magenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

Tertiary colors are the result of combining a primary color with one of its secondary color neighbors. For example, within the RGB color model, red (primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange (tertiary). This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a harmonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to its complement. The three colors provide strong visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using the split-complement scheme:

|   Color   | Hex Code |
| :-------: | :------: |
|  orange   | #FF7F00  |
|   cyan    | #00FFFF  |
| raspberry | #FF007F  |

> **Challenge**
>
>  Change the `background-color` property of the `orange`, `cyan`, and `raspberry` classes to their respective colors. Make sure to use the hex codes and not the color names. 

```html
<style>
  body {
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
  }

  .orange {
    background-color: #FF7F00;
  }

  .cyan {
    background-color: #00FFFF;
  }

  .raspberry {
    background-color: #FF007F;
  }

  div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
  }
</style>

<div class="orange"></div>
<div class="cyan"></div>
<div class="raspberry"></div>
```

##### 28.Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors

The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain content on the page.

> **Challenge**
>
> This page will use a shade of teal (`#09A7A1`) as the dominant color, and its orange (`#FF790E`) complement to visually highlight the sign-up buttons. Change the `background-color` of both the `header` and `footer` from black to the teal color. Then change the `h2` text `color` to teal as well. Finally, change the `background-color` of the `button` to the orange color.

##### 29.Adjust the Hue of a Color

Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the `hsl()` property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics.

**Hue** is what people generally think of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In `hsl()`, hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360.

**Saturation** is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage with 100% being fully saturated.

**Lightness** is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color.

Here are a few examples of using `hsl()` with fully-saturated, normal lightness colors:

|  Color  |         HSL         |
| :-----: | :-----------------: |
|   red   |  hsl(0, 100%, 50%)  |
| yellow  | hsl(60, 100%, 50%)  |
|  green  | hsl(120, 100%, 50%) |
|  cyan   | hsl(180, 100%, 50%) |
|  blue   | hsl(240, 100%, 50%) |
| magenta | hsl(300, 100%, 50%) |

> **Challenge**
>
> Change the `background-color` of each `div` element based on the class names (`green`, `cyan`, or `blue`) using `hsl()`. All three should have full saturation and normal lightness.

```html
<style>
